Openbay
=======
We, the team that brought you https://isohunt.to and http://oldpiratebay.org are bringing you the next step in torrent evolution. The Pirate Bay source code.

Torrent sites like Isohunt and The Pirate Bay taught us a lesson that would be a crime to ignore. Individual torrent sites are easy targets. 
Pirate Bay open source code will give absolutely anyone with minimal knowledge of networking, website design, and server operations the opportunity to create a Pirate Bay copy on his/her own domain.

Installation
=======

**Step 1. Download source.**

Download the latest engine version at openbay.isohunt.to or at GitHub project web page.

Upload the source code to desirable web hosting following the web hosting guide (in common case there is a CPanel tool) or just use FTP

This step is quite optional. It depends on your web hosting. Some hostings can unzip sources automatically some of them allows you to make it manually.
